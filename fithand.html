                        <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Engage Trainers more efficiently by motivating them to keep focused through a more personalized and goal-oriented program. </li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> The solution proposed is a mobile application which serves as a personal assistant. Engage Trainers more efficiently by motivating them to keep focused through a more personalized and goal-oriented program. </li>
                        <li><strong>My Role:</strong> This is one of my self-initiative personal project idea which was pitched in early Winter 2017, and I refined the project this winter 2020. From this project, I would like to challenge myself to bring out my creativity and nurture my passion. I took the whole responsibility for strategizing, ideating solutions, prototyping UI, and defining. For deliverables of the product visual design, I produced from branding collaterals and all the UIs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3 Weeks, Winter 2017</li>

                    <p class="pb03">FitHand provides a solution that allows trainers and trainees to participate in this virtual personal trainer platform and workout marketplace. FitHand matches trainers and trainees at hand, letting you choose who is right for you.</p>
                    <p class="pb03">It allows trainers to build and schedule trainee fitness goals by giving customized workouts. It also builds a good relationship between the trainer and trainee by asking questions and acknowledging insightful advice.</p>

                    <h4 class="pb03">THE CHALLENGE</h4>
                    <p>By growing the personal training business 10% per year, Trainers have limited time to meet with individual clients. Clients who are not interested in personal training and even in the workouts are difficult to motivate outside of sessions. It takes a lot of money to attract new customers, so It is difficult to find new clients and build consistent relationships.

                    <h4 class="pb03">CONTEXTUAL INQUIRIES</h4>
                    <p class="pb03">As life expectancy has increased and income levels have improved, interest in health, which affects the quality of life, has naturally increased. This is in line with the global demand for health-related consumption, not only in developed countries that are now centered, but also in some developing countries where income levels are rapidly improving.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt10"></h3>
                    <h4 class="pb03">INSIGHT</h4>
                    <p class="pb03">To serve the clients, trainers use different techniques like using workouts that they created with multiple clients for maximizing the efficiency. However, with the FitHand, they can focus on sustaining a balance between giving a personalized experience and training. Also, they can manage their time by using the app conveniently.</p>
                    <p class="pb03">Almost of all trainers have a clear knowledge of their clients’ information and habits even if they are not with them. So they try their best to suggest better habits for the trainees. Trainers have their limitation to take care of their trainees which resulted in a loss of about half of clients. However, with the FitHand, trainers can save a lot of time by giving suggestions through a centralized hub system.</p>
                    <p class="pb03">The interviews indicate that almost all of the trainers are satisfied with their jobs and want to keep doing them. With the Fit Hand, trainers can manage their clients more efficiently.

                    <h4 class="pb03">UNDERSTANDING THE USERS</h4>
                    <p>I performed user interviews and conducted surveys to derive insight from the customers. Based on the research results I understood that users have different motivations in using a product. From here, I created personas to prioritize the type of users to my application. I have divided the personas into three categories: A person who does not work out, a person who likes to work out and a personal trainer. At first, I planned to phase my product only to support the goals of the trainer. Yet, I believe that for a better result, benefiting more than one group should be added in my design process. Therefore, I considered the variety range of groups of personas.

                    <P>Building the personas had helped to remind the stakeholders about the product, make effective design decisions, and to provide innovative solutions.</P>

                    <h4 class="pb03">SUPPORTED PLATFORM</h4>
                    <p>I decided to choose mobile for the supported platform for following reasons:</p>
                    <p>Portable, more accessible than web</p>
                    <p>Users could find the most suitable trainers at anytime, anywhere</p>
                    <p>Enables to see workout updates from trainers</p>
                    <p>Devloping prototypes and rapidly iterating are all based on testing results. We learned even small things, like this age range tends to find it easier to click buttons on the bottom of the ipad. We had all of our directional controls at the top, and they were not getting used!

                    <p>For this project, I wanted to make the flow simple, so trainers don't get frustrated by the prolong process of matching the suitable trainees and managing the clients.

                    <p>1. Trainers can manage their time by using day, week, and month view of calendar to see upcoming appointments.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Trainers can set up appointments on their own calendar that other people can reserve. So they can manage their time flexibly.

                    <p>Customers or users always incline to the best that satisfies their needs. User research, Market Research, and Usability studies have changed my perspectives on how users would go about choosing a product.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="pb03"></h3>
                    <h4 class="pb03">IMPORTANCE OF USER TESTING</h4>
                    <p>Conducting user testing and cognitive walkthroughs were the best way to find out usability issues in the interface of the app. Most of the users discovered the application intuitive and could easily navigate between the screens.
